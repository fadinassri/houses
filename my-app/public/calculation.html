  <h1>House Cost Calculator Explanation</h1>
  <p>This document explains how the House Cost Calculator works, including the equations used for each calculation.</p>

  <h2>Mortgage Monthly Payment</h2>
  <p>
    The mortgage monthly payment is calculated using the formula for an amortizing loan:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>
      M = (r * P) / (1 - (1 + r)^(-n))
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>Where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>M</b> is the monthly payment</li>
    <li><b>P</b> is the loan amount (house price - down payment)</li>
    <li><b>r</b> is the monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12)</li>
    <li><b>n</b> is the total number of payments (loan period in years * 12)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Other Monthly Payments</h2>
  <p>
    Other monthly payments include taxes, insurance, utilities, and maintenance fees. This is calculated as:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>
      OtherMonthlyPayment = (AnnualTax / 12) + MonthlyInsurance + UtilityPerMonth + MaintenanceFeesPerMonth
    </code>
  </p>

  <h2>Total Monthly Payment</h2>
  <p>
    The total monthly payment is the sum of the mortgage monthly payment and other monthly payments:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>
      TotalMonthlyPayment = MortgageMonthlyPayment + OtherMonthlyPayment
    </code>
  </p>

  <h2>Equity Monthly Gain</h2>
  <p>
    Equity monthly gain is calculated as the principal paid per month adjusted for buying and selling costs, plus any increase in house value:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>
      EquityMonthlyGain = (Principal / TotalMonths) - (BuyingCost / TotalMonths) - (SellingCost / TotalMonths) + ((SellingPrice - HousePrice) / TotalMonths)
    </code>
  </p>

  <h2>Real Monthly Payment</h2>
  <p>
    The real monthly payment is the total monthly payment adjusted by the equity monthly gain:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>
      RealMonthlyPayment = TotalMonthlyPayment - EquityMonthlyGain
    </code>
  </p>

  <h2>Cash Gain After Sell</h2>
  <p>
    The cash gain after selling the house is calculated as:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>
      CashGainAfterSell = Principal - BuyingCost - SellingCost + (SellingPrice - HousePrice)
    </code>
  </p>

  <h2>Interest and Principal</h2>
  <p>
    Over the holding period, interest and principal are calculated using the remaining loan amount and monthly interest rate. For each month:
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>
      Interest = RemainingLoanAmount * MonthlyInterestRate
    </code>
    <br>
    <code>
      Principal = MortgageMonthlyPayment - Interest
    </code>
  </p>
  <p>
    The remaining loan amount decreases by the principal paid each month.
